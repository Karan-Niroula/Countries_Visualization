30DaysofJavaScript: Day 25 mini project

Priority Zero(0) features:
1. Two buttons i.e population and languages
if any btn clicked:
Data pops up in bar graph
if population btn clicked:
Displays 10 most populated counties in world
if languages btn clicked:
Displays 10 most spoken languages in the world


How to approach:
1. We have the json data with all information of the countries
2. Parse the JSON object
3. Iterate though the parsed array, and map out the 10 most spoken language
4. Iterate and map out the 10 most populated countries

1. Make a grid layout with 3 columns:
  1st column: Country Name /language Name 2nd column: Bar Chart (with animation)
3rd cloumn: no of countries where the language is         spoken/population

2. The mapped array of "most populated country" should be iterated and a new element "p" should be created and appended inside the 1st grid column

3. The mapped array of "most spoken language" should be iterated and a new element "p" should be created and appended inside the 3rd grid column


For the graph-display in 2nd column:
   each time a the mapped array are iterated, another empty div will be created and appened in the 2nd column.
   
The width of the div will be manipulated using the keyframes animation. i.e: create a root variable with a name --graph-width,
the variable will be used in the keyframs ...{from: ...; to: var(--graph-width)
}
and the value will be passed there using javascript.

But How will the graph width be determined??

1. Total population /Total countries : Total should have a width of 100%
2. Width of any particular country = 100/total population * no population in 1 country
3. Width of any particular language = 100/total languages * no of countries that speak 1 language
